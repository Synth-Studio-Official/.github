  <br> Synth Studio: Welcome to our studio!
</h1>


# What we are
Synth Studio is a Haxe/HaxeFlixel game development studio, so we can work on all kinds of games! We try our very best to keep development on games moding, especially considering we're working on 3 games simultaniously! There are groups of people who work on one or multiple games of their choosing! This all sounds great, but in reality, we have no where near enough people for each game to move forward in development consistantly! For one of the projects, it have no programmers on it. For another, there simply isn't enough people, and for the third one, there's only programmers. Thats why...

# We need your help!
If you code in Haxe/HaxeFlixel, draw any sort of art, make any sort of music, or at good at leading groups of people to complete a given task, ***please contact us!*** You can get in touch with our email, *officialsynthstudio@gmail.com*! We would take in any sort of help you can give! The only catch is that this work is currently unpaid, as we have no funds quite yet. Once we do get funds, work will be paid via commissions!

# How we came to be
Way back when, the director and their friend made *Synth Productions* for the purpose of making games. Although at the time, it was suffering and they had no idea how to direct a small team, let along make any sort of good games. Thus, quite quickly, it faded away. Although much later, them and that same friend had the idea of bringing it back, but as something new. So with much more determination then ever, it came back, now known as *Synth Studio!* Again, please join if you can so this re-attempt doesn't fade away again.
